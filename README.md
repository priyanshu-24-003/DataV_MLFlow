- plumber handles pipeline as all the other plumbers do :) . 

## Notes

        1. once you make the plumber run the pipeline expect following artifacts:

                    /data/logs
                    /data/interim
                    /data/raw
                    /data/models
                    /data/processed
                    /data/reports
